# Dotfiles

An installable environment!

### Features

The features you'll enjoy if you choose to install my setup:

1. A nice vim setup with lots of plugins (especially for haskell/ruby).
2. A nice zsh setup using oh-my-zsh (sorin's fork)
3. An interesting approach to screen (optional, should be configured).
4. Decent gitconfig/ignore.
5. A nice, minimal irssi with useful scripts loaded.
6. Tweaks for common utilities like htop, xcolors, etc.

### Usage

1. Clone or fork-then-clone the repo
2. Customize if desired
3. Sanity-check the Rakefile
4. `rake install`

Note: Installation will backup any existing files (but clobber any 
existing symlinks).
