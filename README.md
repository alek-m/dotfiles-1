# Dotfiles

Various configuration files for my main system. Take what you like.

### Automatic usage

I now use a symlink approach (via my [dotfiles][] script) which symlinks 
a subset of these dotfiles (specified by a mapping file on each machine) 
to the correct locations under `~/` and `/root/`. See the comments in 
this script for more details if you're intested.

### Note

For my vimrc, please see its own [repo][vim-repo], same goes for my
[xmonad][xmonad-repo] setup.
